# CATIS Roadmap

Here is a high-level project roadmap with milestones and estimated timelines:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing** (1-2 weeks)

    - Identify relevant cybersecurity datasets (e.g., domain-specific datasets, logs, and threat intelligence feeds).

    - Develop data preprocessing scripts to clean, format, and normalize the data for further processing.

    - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Development and Fine-tuning** (3-4 weeks)

    - Research and select appropriate LLM-inspired architecture and neural network technologies for the system.

    - Implement and fine-tune the models on the preprocessed cybersecurity datasets.

    - Incorporate context-aware and risk-sensitive mechanisms into the model.

3. **System Integration and Evaluation** (2-3 weeks)

    - Develop scripts to combine Context Aware Event Severity Layers and Numerically Augmented Data Source into a final numerical representation.

    - Integrate the CATIS system with existing security tools like SNORT and SURICATA/ZEEK.

    - Evaluate the system's performance using standard metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

4. **Visualization and Frontend Development** (2-3 weeks)

    - Design and implement a user-friendly frontend for visualizing the finalized threat event table.

    - Ensure compatibility with different log formats and customization options.

5. **Testing and Validation** (1-2 weeks)

    - Perform comprehensive testing to validate the system's accuracy and effectiveness in detecting and prioritizing threat events.

    - Ensure that the system meets all requirements and performs reliably.

6. **Documentation and Deployment** (1-2 weeks)

    - Create comprehensive documentation covering the system architecture, usage, and troubleshooting.

    - Prepare the system for deployment, ensuring compatibility with the target infrastructure.

7. **Maintenance and Updates** (Ongoing)

    - ontinuously monitor the system's performance and address any issues that arise.

    - Periodically update the system with new data, models, and improvements to maintain its effectiveness.

    - Please note that these timelines are estimates and can vary depending on the complexity of the tasks, availability of resources, and other factors.
