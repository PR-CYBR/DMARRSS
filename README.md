# CATIS: Context-Aware Event Processing Model And Threat Intelligence System for Infrastructure Security

CATIS is a novel solution that employs LLM-inspired architecture and neural network technology to detect and prioritize threat events in distributed systems. It focuses on highlighting only the most relevant endpoints with the highest level of threat, ensuring better-informed decision-making for security analysts and administrators.

## Features

- Context-aware event processing for accurate threat detection
- Integration of Context Aware Event Severity Layers for prioritizing events
- Advanced algorithmical processing techniques inspired by LLM technology
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific cybersecurity datasets
- Compatible with existing security tools like SNORT and SURICATA/ZEEK
- Visualizations for customized logs
