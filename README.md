# CATIS - Context-Aware Event Processing Model And Threat Intelligence System for Infrastructure Security

CATIS is a novel solution that leverages advanced algorithmical processing techniques inspired by Large Language Model (LLM) technology and neural networks to detect and prioritize threat events in distributed systems. The system highlights only relevant endpoints with the highest level of threat and enables security analysts and administrators to make better-informed decisions, respond more effectively to threats, and maintain a higher level of security across their distributed infrastructure systems.

## Features
- LLM-inspired architecture
- Context-sensitive mechanisms for accurate threat event understanding
- Context Aware Event Severity Layers for prioritizing events
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific cybersecurity datasets
- Compatible with existing security tools like SNORT and SURICATA/ZEEK
